first take a steel container in that put the 2 pc maggi noodle.It is up to you that u want it long noodles or if u want short in length then crush the pcs into four
add 2 cups of boiled water in it. 
add maggi masala to it 
now for the special taste add half teaspoon red chilli powder to it. if you dont want if to be spicy u can avoid this step
now add the magic cube if it is available 
now turn on the gas with caaution 
it is written that it is 2 min maggi but it is not actually 2 mins so keep the game on high flame for 5-7min untill cooked 
then serve it fresh
